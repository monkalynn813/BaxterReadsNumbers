# BaxterReadsNumbers
I upload a number decompose python program, give it an input N, and it returns the decomposed prime numbers, N=x1*x2*x3...


## Note:
I have pushed thepackage.xml and cmakelists.txt I am not sure that they are correct but my code works when I build with them so assuming you have done all teh homeworks yours shoudl work too.
The package name is baxter_fun and I have placed mine within baxterws/src
